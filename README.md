# Reinforcement Learning Directory

Implementations of reinforcement learning (mainly Q-Learning) algorithms in Python and usage on various OpenAI Gym environments (e.g. the Pong environment in the Gif below). This repository is used as a template for the Tensor-WoW project in which an agent (Deep-CNN in combination with RL) plays the game World of Warcraft.
